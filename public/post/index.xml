      <description>This homework is designed to practice the skills we learned in up until Lecture 3: working with loops, conditions, functions, and the built-in Python data structures. Make sure to go through the lecture again in case you have any troubles.
Note: You may not use higher-level library functions but should implement everything using functions, loops, and conditions.
